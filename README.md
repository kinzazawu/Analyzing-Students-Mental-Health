# Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health

We are investigating whether studying in another country affects students' mental health. The main hypothesis of the study is:
- International students have higher levels of depression (PHQ-9) than the general population.
- Social connectedness (SCS) and acculturation stress (ASISS) are correlated with levels of depression.
- A longer stay may affect depression and stress scores.
